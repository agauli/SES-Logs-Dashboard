## Getting Started

To get started with Dashboard, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Send SES events to cloudwatch log. 
  Deploy cloudformation template ses-log-processing-lambda.yaml to set up an AWS Lambda function that process SES logs and send them to CloudWatch for analysis.
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/agauli/SES-Logs-Dashboard.git
   cd SES-Logs-Dashboard
   ```
2. **Setup AWS credentials to read cloudwatch logs**:
   - The recommended approach is to use an IAM role for secure access.

    For local development, pass environment variables when you run the Docker container. 
    ```bash
	docker run -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id \
    -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key \
    -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=your_default_region \
    your_image_name
    ```

2. **Build and Run the Application**:
   ```bash
	docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. **Access the Dashboard**:
	Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:80 for the frontend.
	
	Ensure that the backend service is accessible on port 5000.

	Example Request:
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:5000/api/get_ses_logs?log-group=/aws/ses/event_logs&start-date=2024/08/26&end-date=2024/08/31&event-type=bounce"
   ```
	API Endpoints
	GET /api/get_ses_logs: Retrieve SES logs.
